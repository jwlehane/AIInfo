         <section>
                <p>It can sometimes be tough to brainstorm new gen AI use cases and determine which ones to tackle. One method we recommend trying is the <strong>creative matrix</strong>.</p>
                <p>A creative matrix is great because it can help your team think through different aspects of what gen AI can do. For this creative matrix workflow, you would get a team together and create two axes. The axes are a bit flexible, but we can give you some ideas:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
                    <li>On one axis, you might write the different options for <strong>gen AI solutions</strong>. This can be organized by gen AI product, modality (e.g., text, image, code, audio), or another dimension.</li>
                    <li>On the other axis, you would write out things that are <strong>specific to your business</strong>. This can be business personas (e.g., marketing manager, customer service agent, operations lead), workflows (e.g., content creation, customer support, product design), or strategic goals (e.g., increase efficiency, drive innovation, enhance customer experience).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Then, have the team write sticky notes (either virtually or in person) with different ideas of how the two axes can intersect and place them in the right spot. This should get you to think creatively about how your organization can leverage gen AI to truly help your business priorities.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 border-b pb-2 mb-4">Example: Faux Floral Business</h2>
                <p>Let’s take a look at this creative matrix sample from a team working on a faux floral business. On one axis, they have the business priorities for their faux floral business. On the other axis, they have some Google Cloud gen AI capabilities.</p>
                <p>We will read out just a few examples of what the team can add on sticky notes, and then you will be able to see a few more below this video.</p>

                <div class="sticky-note-example">
                    <p><strong>Example Sticky Note 1:</strong></p>
                    <p>For the overlap between the <strong>Drive Innovation</strong> (Business Priority) section and <strong>Vertex AI Search</strong> (Gen AI Capability), an idea could be: <em>"Create a search tool where customers can upload images to find similar faux floral arrangements."</em></p>
                </div>

                <div class="sticky-note-example">
                    <p><strong>Example Sticky Note 2:</strong></p>
                    <p>If we want to <strong>Enhance Customer Experience</strong> (Business Priority) with <strong>Vertex AI Conversation</strong> (Gen AI Capability), an idea could be: <em>"Build an AI-powered chatbot to provide instant customer support and answer questions about faux floral care, arrangement, and ordering."</em></p>
                </div>

                <div class="sticky-note-example">
                    <p><strong>Example Sticky Note 3:</strong></p>
                    <p>To <strong>Increase Efficiency</strong> (Business Priority), we can use <strong>Vertex AI Studio</strong> (Gen AI Capability) to: <em>"Fine-tune a model to analyze customer data and predict future demand for different faux floral products."</em></p>
                </div>

                <p>There are really so many sticky notes that we can add here, but we want to also give you a chance to practice thinking of some of your own.</p>
